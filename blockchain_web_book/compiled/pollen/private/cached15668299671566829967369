"What does money have to do with consensus? It comes down to the “double spend problem.” If Alice pays Bob some money, she should not then be able to turn around and pay that same money to Carol. With physical coins or cash (Fig. 3), this is obviously solved by the fact that a physical object can be in only one place at a time. (If someone tries to get around that physical law by making a copy of the coin or cash, we call that counterfeiting and punish it.) You can prove that you are entitled to spend a coin by simply handing it over. With a modern electronic payments, like with credit cards or wire transfers, we trust the institutional payment processor (for example, a credit card company or bank) to ensure that money is spent only once (Fig. 4). But what if we want a digital system where we do not need to rely upon any third parties like banks? If Alice pays Bob, we would all need to somehow agree, in a decentralized manner, that Alice has paid Bob and not Carol, and that therefore Bob can now spend that received money, not Alice or Carol.

"Many grassroots advocates of cryptocurrencies referred to cryptocurrencies as “trustless.” First, note that the dictionary definition of “trustless” is “not deserving of trust” or “distrustful.” Neither of those is a particularly appealing quality for a money system, especially the first! Second, even in the sense that its proponents intend it—to denote that one does not need to trust anyone else—the description in our opinion misses the key point. Blockchains enable coordination at scales and in contexts where it was previously impossible without acceptance or imposition of central authority. When viewed in this light, while money has been the initial and primary use for blockchains, its implications are even broader. The financial system is first, but any area involving centralized authorities or platforms is potentially subject to disintermediation with blockchains.")) c (? . 0) c (? . 0) c (c p c (u . "A key component of coordination is verification. As President Ronald Reagan said, “Trust but verify.” Indeed, the first system described to use a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was to certify document timestamps (by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta In 1991). In the case of money, we wish to verify that someone really has rights to what they claim and that given transfers really have occurred. In the case of a “smart contract,” another application of blockchains, we want to ensure that someone is really committed to a given contract and that its terms are followed. By allowing people to have mathematical confidence in certain facts (including prior consensus and the positions of other parties), blockchains enable freer peer to peer coordination without needing to rely on a  third party arbiter.
